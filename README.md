# DungeonCrawler
By: Merwan Yeditha and Sushmit Dutta

## The Game
You are Yoshi, and you've been trapped in an underground dungeon. The only
way out is to travel to the end and find the treasure room! Traverse through
the randomly generated map and rooms to find the treasure room, but be careful!
Foes await! On the way, you'll find the Shy Guy, an enemy who always runs towards
you, and the dangerous ghost, who won't move when you look at him, but will run
after you when you look away and can't be killed!
